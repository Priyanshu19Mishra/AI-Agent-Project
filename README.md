# AI-Agent-Project

Project Overview
The AI Agent project demonstrates the integration of large language models (LLMs) with automated web searches to create an interactive AI tool. Users can upload a dataset, fetch relevant web data for specific queries, and interact with the retrieved data using custom prompts. The app utilizes OpenAI's GPT models for natural language processing and SerpAPI for web searches, all within a user-friendly Streamlit interface.

Key Features
1. CSV File Integration: Upload CSV files to explore and select queries for further analysis.
2. Web Search Automation: Use SerpAPI to fetch web results based on user-selected queries.
3. Custom Prompt Handling: Accept any user-defined prompt for operations on the fetched data.
4. LLM Integration: Leverage OpenAI's GPT to process web data and return meaningful insights based on the prompt.
5. Export Results: Download processed results as a .txt file for offline use.
